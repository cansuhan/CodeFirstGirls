                        Is Still a Rose"</em> ) was sold more than 500,000 times and received gold certification.</li>

                    Center Honors, Franklin let go of her fur coat. According to <em>"Rolling Stone"</em>, dropping the
                    coat was meaningful because it "echoed back to those times when gospel queens would toss their furs
                    on top of coffins".</li>
                <li>Before a Detroit Lions football game in 2016, Franklin sang the national anthem. The Royal

                    New York City, as part of <u> Elton John</u>'s 25th anniversary gala.</li>
                <li>Franklin announced her retirement from touring in February 2017. She postponed a few 2018 concerts
                    before cancelling them on the advise of her doctor owing to health and other difficulties.</li>
                <li>In 2018, the singer was admitted to a Detroit hospital. She died in her home on August 16 of
                    pancreatic cancer. </li>
