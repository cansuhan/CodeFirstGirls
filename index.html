                    movement of the 1930s.

                    Billie Holiday was an American jazz and swing music singer. Holiday had an innovative influence on
                    jazz music and pop singing. Her
                    vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating
                    phrasing and tempo.

        <h2>Why Women Artists?</h2>
        <p>
            In an era when painting, portraiture and the female artist are still regularly dismissed or marginalised,
            only
            one in four of this year's Turner prize nominees are women and none of them work in portraiture or painting,
            while only 5% of commercial London galleries show an equal number of male and female artists.
            <br>
            <br>
            The truth is that women have never been treated equally in the art world, and today they remain dramatically
            underrepresented and undervalued in museums, galleries, and auction houses. Counting and quantifying would
            not solve
            discrimination, but statistics are useful for understanding the scope of the problem. As NMWA Director Susan
            Fisher Sterling says, “People in the art world want to think we are achieving parity more quickly than we
            are.”
            With this website we are hoping to amplify and cherish the works of some of the greatest female artists.
